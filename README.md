The Future of Entire.Life
==========================

Brainstorming possible futures of the Entire.Life app.

The slides, contained in `index.html`, are built using [remarkjs](https://github.com/gnab/remark), which allows you to write your slides in nice simple markdown and turns them into beautiful, browser-powered slides complete with speaker notes. Read its readme to find out more about it.

There's lots of custom styling on the slides, found at the top of the `index.html` file.


How do you know when to quit?
=============================

I always have new ideas. Is it time to call it quits with this one and move on?
